# Progress Log

This file logs the progress made on the project.
[2025-06-26 08:45:00] - RAG Classification Service Implementation Complete

**Status**: Memory Bank documentation update in progress

**Completed Components**:
- ✅ Complete API structure with FastAPI
- ✅ All route endpoints (classification, relationships, health, batch)
- ✅ Core classification logic and relationship extraction
- ✅ LLM integration via OpenRouter for DeepSeek access
- ✅ Storage components (Redis cache, PostgreSQL relationships)
- ✅ Configuration files and deployment setup
- ✅ Modern dependency versions compatible with Python 3.13.4
- ✅ Updated `rag-classification/memory-bank/decisionLog.md` to remove duplicated "Coding Doctrine" section.
- ✅ Updated `rag-classification/memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` to remove duplicated "Coding Doctrine" section.
- ✅ Updated `rag-classification/memory-bank/activeContext.md` with current project focus.
- ✅ Updated `rag-classification/memory-bank/productContext.md` with detailed product context and features.

**Current Issue**:
- Ensuring all `rag-classification/memory-bank/` files accurately reflect the current state of the codebase.

**Next Steps**:
1. Verify all `rag-classification/memory-bank/` files are up-to-date and consistent.
2. Complete documentation for the `rag-classification` service.

**Architecture Decisions**:
- Using OpenRouter.ai for unified LLM access (DeepSeek + fallbacks)
- Render.com deployment with standard Python/gunicorn stack
- Modern FastAPI with Pydantic 2.x for better performance
- Redis + PostgreSQL for caching and relationship storage
[2025-06-26 12:36:34] - Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2) Completed

**Phase 1 Deliverables**:
- ✅ LLM integration with OpenRouter (DeepSeek V3 as primary, other models as fallback)
- ✅ Migration of core document preprocessing logic from rag-server to rag-classification/utils/text_processing.py
- ✅ Implementation of basic SQLite caching for classification results and relationship metadata in rag-classification/storage/
- ✅ Implementation of comprehensive error handling system in rag-classification/core/error_handling.py
- ✅ Implementation of basic relationship extraction (regex-based pattern detection, dependency mapping, WordPress hook identification, integration point discovery) in rag-classification/core/relationship_extractor.py

**Next Phase Focus**:
1. Enhance relationship extraction with more sophisticated NLP techniques
2. Expand test coverage for all Phase 1 components
3. Begin Phase 2 planning (Advanced Features & Optimization)
